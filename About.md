# About

## About us
The world of cyber security is fast-moving and complex. GCERT joins other people and organisations — both locally and internationally — who are already working in this space, to help improve the health of the internet and to better understand and stay resilient to online security threats.
                                            
GCERT works to support businesses, organisations and individuals who are affected (or may be affected) by security incidents and vulnerabilities. We provide trusted and independent information and advice, while also collating a profile of the global threat landscape.

Our GCERT is an organisation that:
* report and tracks vulnerabilities 
* tracks security incidents or attacks, and provides advice and alerts on how to respond and prevent further attacks.

### How we work
To meet the challenges of the digital age, the GDI.foundation has a comprehensive understanding of the threat and vulnerability landscape and the impact of online security threats. To achieve this, GCERT works with other organisations in the online security environment globally across the private, public and not-for-profit sectors and our international counterparts.

### What we do
GCERT primary goal is to improve online security on a global scale, which means:
* an increased comprehension of the threat and vulnerability landscape
* a proactive approach in detection, analyzing, reporting and fixing online vulnerabilities reducing the impact of known vulnerabilities.
* We’ll analyse the international online landscape and will report on vulnerabilities. 
* We’ll gather information from the GDI.foundation programs and research divisions. Reporting will include advisories and alerts, and other reports where appropriate.
* We’ll triage reported incidents and assist businesses, organisations and individuals in getting help through our portal, which caters to both our specialist and non-specialist audiences.
