## Current status
At this moment were setting up our GCERT in the [Netherlands](https://GCERT.NL) and the [Global-CERT here](https://GCERT.GLOBAL). Moreover, in the meantime, we are gathering a big group of enthusiast, passioned professionals to help us reach the next the level. We are currently moving our entire infrastructure to a new secure platform. We are also interviewing several talented and enthusiastic people for several board member positions and run an election for selecting a new chair, vice-chair, treasurer and secretary from our members as we steadily go forward. In the next week we will be setting our [GCERT](https://github.com/GDI-foundation/GDI.foundation/projects/4) which make us more efficient in handling vulnerabilities and provide a systematic response facility to computer security threats and (online) incidents.
